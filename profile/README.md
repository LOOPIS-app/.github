# 🌈 LOOPIS.app introduction

LOOPIS is a non-profit organization established in 2023 in Bagarmossen, Stockholm, Sweden. We make circulation of stuff in a neighbourhood as easy, fun and cheap as possible. Our highly automated web application for ads in combination with a centrally placed locker for exchange creates a hassle-free experience for our members. Our goal is to contribute to a happier and more sustainable future.

## 💾 Environment
We use WordPress as a starting point for our web application, customizing functionality by developing our own modular components (plugins + theme).

## 🧩 Contribution
After becoming a member; Check the list of [issues](https://github.com/search?q=org%3ALOOPIS-app+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen&type=issues), create a new branch with your improvements for the component concerned, and make a pull request to 'staging' for review.

## 📚 Resources
Coming soon: starting guides and more documentation.

## 👥 Team
We aim to infuse a sense of community and collaboration in the coding as well as the usage of our concept. Johan and Hubert are currently employed by LOOPIS HQ to increase development and enable expansion to new areas. Together with a group of volunteering developers we are The Develoopers. Send us a PM if you want to join!
