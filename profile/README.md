# 🌈 LOOPIS introduction

We are a non-profit organization established in 2023 in Bagarmossen, Stockholm, Sweden.

## 🏁 Goal
Contribute to a happier and more sustainable future.

## 💡 Concept
We make circulation of stuff in your neighbourhood as easy, fun and cheap as possible. Our highly automated app interface for ads in combination with a centrally placed locker for exchange creates a hassle-free experience.

## 💾 Environment
For our web application, we use WordPress as a starting point, customizing functionality by developing our own modular components (plugins + theme).

## 👤 The Team
We aim to create a sense of community and collaboration in the coding as well as the usage of our concept. Johan and Hubert are currently employed by LOOPIS HQ to increase development and enable expansion to new areas. Together with a group of volunteering developers we are The Develoopers. Send us a PM if you want to join!
