# 🌈 LOOPIS introduction

We are a non-profit organization established in 2023 in Bagarmossen, Stockholm, Sweden.

## 🏁 Goal
Contribute to a happier and more sustainable future.

## 💡 Concept
We make circulation of stuff in your neighbourhood as easy, fun and cheap as possible. Our highly automated web application for ads in combination with a centrally placed locker for exchange creates a hassle-free experience.

## 💾 Environment
We use WordPress as a starting point for our web application, customizing functionality by developing our own modular components (plugins + theme).

## 👤 Team
We aim to infuse a sense of community and collaboration in the coding as well as the usage of our concept. Johan and Hubert are currently employed by LOOPIS HQ to increase development and enable expansion to new areas. Together with a group of volunteering developers we are The Develoopers. Send us a PM if you want to join!
